# > **This tells me lots of valuable insights. Mostly regarding the soil types. Wanna know? Ok, let me not hide it from you**.
# * It's Just that, there are some of the Soil types which consists of very few counts.  
# * Statistically speaking, for half a million records, balance number per soil type (total 40 in number) is 581012/40 = 14.5k
# * Whereas, here we see a different figure. I know that data need not be balanced all the times. But may be we can get rid of really small size features. Isn't it?
# * Let me list down those along with there size. I'm displaying the Soil type having less than 1000 occurence size

# * I know this will make more sense in a visual such as bar graph right? I'm excited to see it too. But let's infer more from the numbers as of now. 
# * We'll do plottings once we start with Bivariate and Multivariate analysis. 
# * We'll see if we need to really drop the above soil types. 
# * We can only confirm on it if it is not aligned (give any relation) to our target variable i.e Cover_Type. So, please wait, do not conclude. Climax is yet to come :D

# **Let's get started with plots based EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) **
# *  Fun begins here, am I right?
# * Data Distribution of features via Histograms. Although I love box plots more than histograms, we'll use boxplot to check distribution with respect to categorical variable. In our case that is Cover_Type, having 7 different category of classes.
